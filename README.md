### Develop a program for a User Reminder
A program that reads out and processes the qr codes in the qr_codes folder and saves them into a database 
saving the date and time in seperate database fields in the same table. Then a Queue that can hold one value at 
a time which holds always the next upcoming date and time. The Queue should do then the same as in the first task and notify the
user that the date and time is reached. There should also be a native desktop notification for the user and a audio which reminds the user
