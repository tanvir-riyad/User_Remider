### A program that reads out and processes the qr codes in the qr_codes folder and saves them into a database 
saving the date and time in seperate database fields in the same table. Then write a Queue that can hold one value at 
a time which holds always the next upcoming date and time. The Queue should do then the same as in the first task and notify the
user that the date and time is reached. There should also be a native desktop notification for the user (you need a package for this) 
and a audio which reminds the user (you decide if you record it yourself or you take some sound from the web)

Consider writing test before you start coding to prevent bugs and overengeneering from the beginning. ###
